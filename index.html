  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p> As Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie once said, women have often been made to feel responsible for things beyond their control. But awareness brings the power to shift that narrative. </p> <p> Growing up, I noticed how expectations differed for girls and boys. That realization stayed with me — and inspired me to question, learn, and grow. </p> <p> I was taught that marriage was essential for women, while men were seen as simply “taking their time.” It opened my eyes to how deeply cultural norms shape our self-worth — and the importance of defining our own paths. </p> <p> I heard stories of how women were "made for men," yet I now believe we’re each made for purpose — for meaning, not for someone else’s validation. We deserve to be celebrated for who we are, not who we serve. </p> <p> Language matters. Even in our titles, small differences reflect big assumptions. Recognizing that is the first step toward building more equal ground. </p> <p> Sometimes, women are expected to manage others' emotions and behaviors, especially in relationships. But we each deserve to exist freely, without being held responsible for someone else’s choices. </p> <p> A woman can do everything right and still face challenges — not because she is flawed, but because the systems around her are still evolving. And still, women continue to lead, grow, and succeed with grace. </p> <p> I once heard this: the happiest people are married men and unmarried women. Perhaps that’s because women are learning to put their own well-being first — and that’s a powerful thing. </p> <p> Society is full of contradictions. But calling them out isn’t about blame — it’s about building clarity, understanding, and fairness for everyone. </p> <p> For me, faith provides balance. At its best, religion offers shared standards and mutual respect, while society often still wrestles with outdated double standards. But together, we can shape a more just world. </p> <p> When I was dating a programmer, people said I was lucky. But real luck was realizing my own potential — and becoming a programmer myself. That choice changed my life. </p> <p> I believe every woman — whether a first lady, a star, a mother, a coder, or all of the above — brings something valuable. Every story matters. Every life has dignity. No woman’s worth is defined by who she’s with. </p> <p> I love men, and I admire women — all women. I believe in choice, freedom, and mutual respect. Whether someone chooses a career, a family, or both, that decision deserves honor, not judgment. </p> <p> When I watched the <em>Barbie</em> movie, I didn’t see a fantasy. I saw a reflection — a reminder that equality isn't about asking for a seat at the table. It’s about knowing we’ve always deserved one. </p>
