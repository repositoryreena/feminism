      <button class="question">Feminists want women to be superior to men.</button>
<div class="answer">No. Feminism advocates for gender equality — not female supremacy. True feminism includes the liberation of all genders from harmful roles and stereotypes.</div>

<button class="question">Feminism only benefits women.</button>

<button class="question">All feminists are angry or hate men.</button>
<div class="answer">Feminists are rightfully angry at injustice — not men as individuals. That stereotype exists to discredit people speaking out about inequality.</div>

<div class="answer">Feminism is about choice. You can wear makeup, love fashion, and still demand equal rights. Feminine expression and feminism are not mutually exclusive.</div>

  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p>
      As Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie once said, women are born inherently guilty.
      My whole life I was accused of things I never did or even thought of doing — 
      while my brother went unquestioned, free to do as he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was taught that women should get married, that not doing so meant failure. 
      But men? They were just “taking their time.” That stuck with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew up being told Eve was made for Adam — that women were made for men. 
      And when a woman is good, the praise often isn’t “good for you,” 
      but “good for you for being good for your future husband.” 
      Our value is still framed around someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in our titles, the inequality is etched in: men are Mr. — always. 
      Women are Miss, Ms., or Mrs., marked by whether or not they’ve been claimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as a single woman, other people’s relationships become our problem. 
      We’re expected to behave a certain way because “he has a girlfriend” or “don’t lead him on.” 
      Because boys will be boys — and it’s our job to manage them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if a woman behaves perfectly — kind, quiet, modest, smart, careful — she can still be condemned. 
      And even if a man is the worst man in the world, he will not be. 
      If a woman is perfect, she won’t be praised. 
      But if a man shows even a little bit of decency, the world applauds him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a statistic I once heard: the happiest people are married men and unmarried women. 
      Because women carry the emotional labor, the caregiving, the burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman can lose her job over something small, something “inappropriate” or “unbecoming.” 
      But Donald Trump, accused by multiple women of sexual assault, became President. 
      What message does that send?
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Barbie</em> movie wasn’t a fantasy. It was a saddening documentary. 
      The Barbies represented men; the Kens, women. And in the end, when the Barbies said, 
      “Let’s just be a little nicer to the Kens,” it wasn’t a happy ending — just an honest one. 
      It reminded me that women’s equality isn’t a matter of effort, but of permission. 
      And that permission is too rarely granted.
